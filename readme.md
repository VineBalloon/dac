# DAC
Diff. Add. Commit.

# Usage
Just use it. `dac` will call git diff, prompt you to stage, commit, and add a
message to each unstaged file. I even used it to commit to this repo!

# Why?
I recently came across the problem of wanting to add different commit messages
to each of my unstaged files. This was boring and tedious, a perfect candidate
for automation (and a bit more practice with bash)!

# Licensing/Attribution
Free use. Do whatever.
